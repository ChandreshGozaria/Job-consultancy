-> role base login
-> When the client creates any job requirement post it's auto-assign any random Recruiter.
-> you can use any database(MongoDB is a plus point) as a database, and design the schema as per needs
-> no selected schema field for the post, and other schemas, you can choose as per your knowledge.
